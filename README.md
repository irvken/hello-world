It's all going to go wrong

Nobody is going to believe this. I will write, the future is not written 
, I will write it.

Nothing exists in the way we all accept. There is a physical universe but we are in all likelihood not in it, the circunstantial evidence is piling up. I imagine it works like we imagaine a quantum computer works, becuase that is what it most probabaly is. We find the evidence that our universe is quantum based but don't take the next step to wondering if this most likely simulation is just running on a qunatum substarte, like super mario discovering the cpu. I asume that as our quantum expertise increases we will drain increasing resources from the underlying computation to all the concurrent simulations, I wonder if they'll motice us. 

The simulation arguement is a powerful philosophical idea, presented in it's most muscular form in Swedish Nick from Oxford reference here. 

I first encountered it in 1995 when I stumbled across a mailing list called the Extropians, where some wierd and wacky people hung out, expounding and dissecting ideas about the future ina  wierd and wonderful way. I had recently read Drexler's Engines of Creation and Stephenson's The diamind age. I was devouring new nanotech sci-fi and some how found my self with max More's happy bamd. Max More is a californian futurist who along with his long time collobaroator rona vita longlife whatver set up the Extropian Institute awebsite to publisgh and discuss idaes about radical transhumanism
